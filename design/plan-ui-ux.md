# Plan

## Copy

PASTOR framework (Explained in the book _Copy that sells_).

### Copy thesis

Any young guy can get the fanciest, most conversation-starting objects by using **Getiow** — because it finds treasures in the most obscure corners of the internet, so _you_ don't have to.

**Pain behind the problem:** _Not feeling like the coolest guy in the room._

### 🅿️ Person, Problem and Pain

The eyes of others tell wonders about how they perceive you.  
They can be filled with sheer joy… or feel like ice.

As a young man in a hyperconnected world, you’re constantly exposed to the highlight reels of others.  
And deep down, you want to stand out.  
To be remembered.  
To be _the guy_ who always has something unique, stylish, or clever to show.

But right now, you’re missing that edge.  
You scroll endlessly looking for something that feels… _you_.  
Something that makes your friends ask,

> “Where the hell did you get that?”

And too often… you come up empty.

---

### 🅰️ Amplify and Aspirations

Without that unique edge, you risk blending into the background.  
Mediocre gifts. Boring setups. Unremarkable gadgets.

You feel average.  
And when you feel average, you _act_ average.  
Which echoes in your confidence, your social life, even your dating life.

But imagine this instead:

- You pull out a gadget so unique it sparks a 10-minute conversation.
- You give a gift so odd yet thoughtful, it's the highlight of the evening.
- You walk into a room and _people notice_ the tiny things that make you… you.

You don’t just want cool stuff.  
You want _undeniable proof_ of your good taste and personality.

### 🆂 Story, Solution and System

That’s why I built **Getiow**.

I was tired of seeing the same five trending products on every site.  
I wanted a system that found the weird, the rare, the brilliant — so I built one.

**Getiow** connects to curated APIs and marketplaces that most people don’t even know exist.  
Then it filters the noise, finds the gems, and delivers them to you in a clean, smooth, minimal interface.

No clutter. No spam. No trends that died last week.  
Just **pure personality, in product form**.

---

### 🆃 Transformation and Testimony

With Getiow, it’s not about buying random things.  
It’s about transforming your style, your conversations, and your self-image.

You go from _“I never know what to get”_  
to _“Wait ‘til you see what I found on Getiow.”_

You become the guy whose taste becomes contagious.  
Who sets the tone.  
Who sparks curiosity.  
And who never has to pretend — because what you own reflects who you are.

---

### 🅾️ Offer

For a limited time, **Getiow** gives early users access to a handpicked collection of 30+ items we bet you’ve never seen — all under 30€.

No signup. No subscription. Just come in, grab what you love, and go impress your people.

- Colors: Blues, greens and purples are widely used. Lots of light backgrounds (mainly gray), gradients are also common.
- Images: Images or illustrations are always used. 3D illustrations are modern. Sometimes patterns and shapes add visual details
- Icons: Very frequent
- Shadows: Subtle shadows are frequent. Glows are becoming modern.
- Border radius: Border-radius is very common.
- Layouts: Rows of cards and Z-patterns are usual, as well as animations.
